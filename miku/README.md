Potential voice: Hatsune Miku
=============================

Goal
----

A translation of Futuro Cube into Japanese using a *really* cute voice but which is unfortunately very hard to get good speech out of.

Progress
--------

* TODO - Get text translated into Japanese
* Multiple options here:
    * Automated (lower quality, less work)
        * TODO - Find technology to automate generation of VSQx files for speech
        * TODO - Write scripts
    * Manual (higher quality, more work)
        * TODO - Either find someone good at Talkloid to do hard work or get to a decent level myself
        * TODO - Do the hard work, produce one VSQx per line
* TODO - Automate production of WAV files
    * TODO - See what tools I already own have in terms of automation
    * TODO - Get one of them to actually work?
    * TODO - Write scripts
* TODO - Automate conversion of WAV files into whatever bitrate will fit on the cube
    * TODO - Decide whether to write it (easy) or script some existing tool (easy)
    * TODO - Write scripts
