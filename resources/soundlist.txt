Tutorials

_h_GAMEMENU
  "This is the game menu.
   Each side has an icon that represents a game or application.
   To select a particular game, rotate its icon to the top.
   To run the game, give a single tap from the top.
   To get an explanation, and the rules for a selected game, double-tap from the top.
   To reset the game to its original state, and this is very useful for rotation-type puzzles,
   tap from the top at least three times in a row.
   If you tap from the side, you'll get another menu, with a different set of games, or settings."
_t_TUT1
  "Hi, I'm your new Futuro Cube. We're gonna have a lot of fun together.
   But before we start, you have to learn have to communicate with me.
   Remember, my surface is not like your cell phone touchscreen.
   I don't sense your fingers and you can hold me any way you like.
   I understand if you change my position, if you rotate me, if you tap me,
   or if you use some special gestures.
   I prepared a little tutorial for you, but if you don't wanna go over it,
   just leave me still for a while. I'll switch myself off."
_t_TUT2
  "Now we learn how to tap me.
   Try holding me firmly with one hand, while tapping lightly with your index finger from your other hand.
   At the beginning, it's better if you hit with the tip rather than the pad.
   During the tapping action, make sure to hold the cube steady.
   Also, try to hit the centre of the side, rather than the edges.
   Practice a few times, and you'll find you don't have to use much force at all.
   The steadier you hold, the less force that is needed.
   There's a moving spot, which goes towards the side you tap on.
   It moves one spot at a time.
   Navigate this moveable spot to pick up all the diamonds. DIAMONDS."
_t_TUT3
  "Okay, we're making good progress.
   Now we got a little puzzle for you.
   Actually, it's the first game you can play.
   Sometimes there's a difference if you tap from the top than when you tap from the sides.
   Let's practice that.
   Each side of the cube has a different icon and a different colour.
   To complete this little game, you have to make all the icons one shape and one colour.
   It's actually easy. You rotate the cube, try to click the top and from the side; see what happens.
   You should be able to solve this really quickly."
   * 'click' here should have been 'tap'
_t_TUT4
  "Great job so far! Now [we'll] learn a very nice feature.
   The cube has its own cursor, imagined as a spot at the very top of the cube,
   no matter how you rotate or hold me.
   Therefore, we call it a gravity cursor.
   Sometimes it's visible, sometimes not,
   but it's used very often, and it's important to get the right feeling for it.
   So to pass this exercise, make a tight circular path with the gravity cursor around all stable spots.
   If you do complete the circle correctly, the spot will disappear.
   Make all the spots disappear, and we'll move forward."
_t_TUT5
  "Congratulations! You're just two steps from all the challenges I have for you.
   Now we'll learn how to open the game menu any time during your play.
   From this menu, you can later start any game you like.
   We call this action the 'menu gesture'. How to do it?
   Hold the cube in your hand and make a circular motion about the size of a CD.
   You have to do it more than twice and with the speed as if you are cleaning windows.
   The real magic is that during the circular motion, you don't rotate your wrist at all,
   just wax on, wax off. But... just wax on.
   It's a little bit unusual, but like Daniel-san, you'll master it soon.
   After a while, you find you can do the motion much smaller than that of a CD,
   but remember, do not rotate your wrist, and use proper speed.
   Do it three times, and we're almost finished."
   * Ugh, Karate Kid, someone has to kill this thing with fire.
_t_TUT6
  "Lastly, a very useful thing to know is how to switch me on and off.
   Remember, you can only do this in the main menu.
   If you've already mastered how to tap me, try double-tapping me, from the bottom.
   I'll wait for your signal. I'll suspend myself to save energy.
   To wake me up again, simply do the menu gesture that you already know.
   If I don't wake up, maybe my battery is low. I need to be recharged.
   Or maybe I'm in transportation mode, or maybe I'm ignoring you.
   In all cases, plug the USB cable into me.
   And now, once more, let's test the double-tap, three times."
_t_TUT7
  "Great! Now the tutorial is over.
   I'm gonna start the game menu for you.
   If you wanna run the tutorial again, just find it on the menu.
   Now, let the fun begin. Enjoy!"

Explanation of each game/app

_e_CONNECT
  "Try to beat the connecting force of the cube.
   The aim is to connect any two centre symmetric spots before your opponent.
   You cannot, however, connect on a diagonal line.
   You'll take turns.
   After your opponent moves, adjacent spots or his move, and some others, are forbidden for you.
   If you hear an alert beeping, move the cubes closer - you might be too far for communication."
   * This last line about the alert is probably an error, and refers to _e_MULTICONNECT below.
     It is included here for completeness.

_e_CUBRIS
  "Tetris on a cube. Who wouldn't wanna try that?
   Tap on a side to rotate the piece.
   Tap from the top to place that piece.
   If you fill a side, that side disappears.
   If you create a ring around the cube, the ring disappears.
   If you do it with the same colour, BONUS!
   Remember, the pieces will always appear on the same side, and you have to pick them up.
   You can't fill that side, but it's wise to start placing as far as possible from that
   position."

_e_DREAMQUEST
  "Ready your brain to serve as a display unit.
   A new random maze is generated, but you never see the maze!
   You walk through the maze, by... rotating the cube... like you would do if... you were... a walking cube.
   If you hit a wall, the cube will let you know.
   Find all the sound spots, and make your journey from the lowest sound spot to the highest.
   You have to go in order, otherwise you fail."

_e_GOMOKU
  "Try to beat the dark force of the cube.
   This is the classic five-in-a-row, on a cubic surface.
   Special rule is that diagonals of opposite sides are connected.
   Rememeber, you have to confirm every move you make.
   If you miss the right spot, move the cursor away and try again.
   May the force be with you."
   * Star Wars reference here.

_e_GRAVITYCH
  "This is a very relaxing game and I'm not going to give any hints how to play.
   That's part of the game; you'll figure it out.
   Okay, I lied. I'll give you some hints.
   You only work with the top side... and spots like falling down if they can. Try to tap!
   I can also tell ya,
   you have to collect all spots of the same colour in one uniquely coloured connected area.
   This area is not limited to one single side.
   Diagonal connection is not counted,
   and different coloured connected areas cannot directly touch each other.
   To reset this puzzle to its original state, tap the menu from the top at least three times."

_e_GRAVITYP
  "The gravity puzzle is a lovely rotation puzzle. If you like Rubik's cube, try this.
   You need to get each colour on its own side.
   All transfers are by side tap and top tap.
   To reset this puzzle to its original state, tap the menu from the top at least three times."

_e_MULTICONNECT
  "This game is for two players with two cubes.
   The aim is to connect any two centre symmetric spots before your opponent.
   You cannot, however, connect on a diagonal line.
   You'll take turns.
   After your opponent moves, adjacent spots or his move, and some others, are forbidden for you.
   If you hear an alert beeping, move the cubes closer - you might be too far for communication."

_e_MULTICUBRIS
  "Have you mastered Cubris for one player? Then here's the right challenge for you and one of your friends.
   Connect your cubes, and you'll receive the same set of pieces to place.
   Time is running, and you must survive, otherwise your score is not counted.
   If you finish faster, you gain some points for your opponent's laziness.
   However, what if you place the pieces slower, but smarter?  OH, SNAP!"

_e_MULTIGOMOKU
  "Five-in-a-row for two players with two cubes.
   It's the same rules as Gomoku.
   If you hear the cube alert beeping, go closer with the cubes - you might be too far for communication."

_e_PIANO
  "♬ Play that funky music ♬ ...ah, sorry.
   Welcome to our musical challenge.
   Expect lots of practice, and try to be precise by hitting the centre of the sides.
   You have six tones available for each rotation of the cube,
   therefore just playing the full scale can be difficult.
   Once you master a complicated piece, share it on the Internet."

_e_RINGDREAM
  "This is a very delicate and motion-sensitive game for long, romantic evenings.
   Nah, it's just an easy rotation puzzle; everybody can solve it.
   Just select the ring by rotating the cube and then by tapping, twist the ring.
   The ring will rotate one spot for each tap.
   Once every side is the same colour, you're done!
   To reset this puzzle to the original state, tap the menu from the top at least three times."

_e_ROADRUNNER
  "Keep the roadrunner on the top side. The faster you follow, the faster he moves.
   If you're not fast enough, he waits for you, but you lose your speed in distance.
   Try to go as far as possible."

_e_SNAKE
  "Eat as many apples as you can, without eating yourself.
   Sounds easy. Normally you wouldn't eat yourself anyway, right?
   Well then, let's see what your final score'll be."

_e_SOKOBAN
  "The classic computer game on a Futuro-surface.
   It makes perfect sense to play this game on a cube, 'cos you can always move it aside (wink wink.)
   We've prepared the mazes; your goal is to move the bricks to the right spots.
   You change your position by tapping on the sides.
   If you wanna take your move back, just tap the bottom.  [lewd] Hehehe... tap the bottom."

_e_TRANSPORT
  "Transportation mode. This is such a turn-off.
   You're gonna have to plug a USB cable into me to turn me on again."

_e_TUTORIAL
  "Here you've found a great introduction to Futuro Cube for new players.
   We'll go through several basic steps to show you how to control me, and what's important to know.
   Go ahead, I have your instructions ready."

_e_VOLUMECNTRL
  "Select the right volume for speech and music, and confirm it by tapping from the top."

_h_NOHELP
  "Sorry, I... cannot help you."
_j_TAPTHREETIMES
  "You have to tap three times."
